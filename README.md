# BGTY-Final

README

“Be Good To Yourself” is a straightforward event tracker and countdown App. User can add as many events as they want. Events are automatically saved after they are created/edited.  The app includes the ability to create ToDo lists and budget sheets for each event. Users can add their event to their local calendar and share them with social media apps.  Finally, BGTY includes a special feature called the “MG” Coefficient, which visually removes 2 days from the overall countdown; the first days, which really doesn’t count, and the final day, which also really doesn’t count, especially if you are excited and really to be good to yourself.
